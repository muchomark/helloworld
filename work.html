            <p class="section-text">My three friends and I opened Cafe Le Gaz in April 2024 with no prior experience. With our combined knowledge and the help of our community, we designed a cohesive floor plan and a distinctive identity for our space. We read countless books, spent hours learning about coffee and hospitality, took in-person barista classes, and toured dozens of cafes and restaurants for inspiration and direction. The result of our three-month sprint is a one-of-a-kind team that understands our standards and protocols, intentional relationships with our partners and distributors, and a growing presence within our neighborhood and beyond.</p>

            <p class="section-text">In an effort to create a product that our market needed, my co-founder and I partnered with a developer to create a mobile app for release alerts and news. We spent nearly a year developing the blueprint for our app, outlining the ideal user experience and marketing strategy. Since launch, we have amassed over 10,500 downloads and more than 2,000 monthly active users.</p>

            <p class="section-text">StockX reached out to my co-founder and I in early 2019 to discuss how we could potentially work together to drive more traffic to their marketplace. After several weeks of strategizing and development, we built StockXSupply, an online feed on X (formerly Twitter) and Discord that alerts users of price drops and deals based on our defined thresholds within the StockX marketplace. Since working together, we have generated over $10M in sales for StockX, and our monitors are now hosted in more than 600 Discord communities.</p>

            <p class="section-text">Upon noticing a gap in the growing market of sneakers and streetwear, my co-founder and I built the missing piece that would democratize the information connecting users to limited and highly sought-after releases. We manage over 20 contractors, maintain a growing product and content database, and develop marketing campaigns for notable releases. We've created an online media hub that receives millions of monthly impressions and has amassed a cumulative following of more than 600,000 people across platforms.</p>
