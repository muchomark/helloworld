            <p class="section-text">For Christopher; DOGMA; Blonde Inc.; FWB Dept.; Public Image; dotdotdot; and all affiliated parties,</p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-text">I hope you're enjoying the start of a fresh week. I know that this may not be the most conventional way to introduce myself. That's precisely why I have faith that it just might work. What law says that a resume lives within the bounds of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper?</p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-text">After an introspective dinner with my partner and a few cumulative hours working on this site, I'd like to express my interest in working alongside the team at dotdotdot. I've been a follower for a while and I've admired the approach the brand has taken and am genuinely excited to see where it can go. It's sophisticated yet playful. It's educating and refreshing. It's everything and never excessive.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-text">With a background that spans the worlds of physical and digital, I'd love to be part of what's being built at dotdotdot. If I am looking back at my career, it's difficult for me to limit myself to a particular "role." Strategy? Growth? Project Management? Marketing? Fashion? Hospitality? It's less about indecision and more a rejection of this idea that you have to be the master of one trade. As the saying goes: "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-text">So here we are. If you've gotten this far, then I must have your attention, and we know how valuable that is in today's day and age. I appreciate your curiosity but more importantly your generosity with your time. I could've probably sent an email, but a combination of Blonde Inc.'s open application and my own personal desire to translate my skills into a different environment brought me here to this moment. And now you.</p>
